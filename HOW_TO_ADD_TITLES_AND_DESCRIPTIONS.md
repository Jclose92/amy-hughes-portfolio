# How to Add Titles and Descriptions to Gallery Files

Your gallery files (videos, images, audio) get their titles and descriptions from the **Google Drive file name and description**.

## Simple 3-Step Process

### Step 1: Open Google Drive
Go to the folder containing your media files (Showreels, Screen Work, Voice Demos, etc.)

### Step 2: Edit the File Name (This becomes the TITLE)
1. Right-click on the file
2. Select **"Rename"**
3. Type your title
4. Press Enter

**Example:**
```
Before: VID_20231015.mp4
After:  Commercial Showreel 2024
```

### Step 3: Add a Description (This becomes the DESCRIPTION)
1. Right-click on the file
2. Select **"File information"** or **"Details"** (or press `Ctrl+Alt+I` / `Cmd+Option+I`)
3. In the panel that opens, find the **"Description"** field
4. Type your description
5. Click outside or close the panel (it saves automatically)

**Example:**
```
Description: Featuring work from Nike, Apple, and BBC campaigns
```

## What Shows Up Where

### File Name → Gallery Title
- Shows in **large white text** below the media
- Should be short and descriptive
- Examples:
  - "Commercial Showreel"
  - "BBC Drama Scene"
  - "Character Voice Reel"

### File Description → Gallery Description
- Shows in **smaller white text** below the title
- Can be longer and more detailed
- Examples:
  - "Featuring dramatic scenes from EastEnders and Casualty"
  - "Voiceover work for animated series and video games"
  - "Comedy sketches from Edinburgh Fringe 2024"

---

## Best Practices

### ✅ Good Titles (Short & Clear)
- "Commercial Showreel 2024"
- "BBC Drama - Casualty"
- "Character Voices"
- "Edinburgh Fringe Highlights"

### ❌ Avoid
- "VID_20231015_final_v2.mp4" (too technical)
- "My amazing incredible showreel that shows all my best work" (too long)
- Leaving it blank (visitors won't know what they're watching)

### ✅ Good Descriptions (Informative)
- "Featuring commercial work for Nike, Apple, and Samsung"
- "Dramatic scenes from BBC's Casualty and EastEnders"
- "Character voices including animation and video game work"
- "Stand-up comedy from Edinburgh Fringe Festival 2024"

### ❌ Avoid
- Leaving it blank (missed opportunity to provide context)
- Repeating the title exactly
- Too much text (keep it under 2-3 lines)

## Example Workflow

Let's say you have a showreel video:

1. **Upload** `showreel.mp4` to your Google Drive folder
2. **Rename** it to: `Commercial Showreel 2024`
3. **Add description**: `Featuring work from Nike, Apple, BBC, and ITV campaigns`
4. **Refresh** your website
5. **See it appear** with the title and description!

## Important Notes

- Changes appear **immediately** after refreshing your website
- You can edit titles and descriptions **anytime** without re-uploading files
- The site **automatically** pulls this information from Google Drive
- Make sure the files are in the **correct Google Drive folder** for each gallery section

## Folder Structure Reminder

Your Google Drive folders should be organized like this:

```
📁 Showreels/
   📹 Commercial Showreel 2024.mp4
   📹 Acting Showreel 2024.mp4

📁 Screen Work/
   📹 BBC Drama Scene.mp4
   📹 Netflix Series Clip.mp4

📁 Voice Demos/
   🎵 Commercial Voice Reel.mp3
   🎵 Character Voices.mp3

📁 Stage/
   🖼️ Hamlet Production.jpg
   🖼️ Comedy Show.jpg
```

Each file's **name** = **title** on your website
Each file's **description** = **description** on your website

That's it! Simple and easy to update anytime. 🎬
