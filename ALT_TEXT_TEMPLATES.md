## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Include project names, venues, and roles when known
2. **Stay Natural**: Write for humans first, search engines second
3. **Vary Keywords**: Don't repeat the same phrase on every image
4. **Keep it Concise**: 125 characters or less when possible
5. **Include Location**: "Dublin" or "Ireland" helps local SEO
6. **Add Context**: What is Amy doing in this image?
7. **Avoid Keyword Stuffing**: Use 2-3 keywords maximum per alt text
8. **Update Regularly**: Keep alt text current with new projects

## Implementation Notes

When adding images to Google Drive folders, include alt text in:
- **File description field** (if using Google Drive metadata)
- **Filename** (use descriptive names: "amy-hughes-showreel-vikings.jpg")
- **Code implementation** when rendering images

---

**Remember**: Alt text should be descriptive enough to paint a picture for someone who can't see the image, while naturally including relevant keywords for SEO.
